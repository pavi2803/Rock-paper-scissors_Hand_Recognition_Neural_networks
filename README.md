# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with Hand Recognition

This Rock-Paper-Scissors game leverages computer vision and neural networks to create an interactive gameplay experience where players compete against the system. Utilizing OpenCV for hand recognition and neural networks for response analysis, the game offers real-time gameplay.

## About This Application

The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a classic hand game that involves players choosing one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. This application modernizes the game by allowing users to play against a system that uses advanced hand recognition techniques to interpret their choices and respond accordingly.

### Key Features

- **Hand Recognition**: Utilizes OpenCV and neural networks to detect and interpret hand gestures in real-time.
- **Real-Time Gameplay**: Provides an interactive experience with immediate responses based on the user’s input.
- **System Response**: The system analyzes the user’s hand gesture and generates a response, simulating a real opponent.

### Tech Stack

- **OpenCV**: Employed for real-time hand detection and gesture recognition.
- **Neural Networks**: Used to classify hand gestures and determine user choices.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing the game logic and image processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras (for neural networks)

### Installation
